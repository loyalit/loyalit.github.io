        <h1>SOLUTIONS TO DIABETES</h1>
        
        <p>Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Uncontrolled cases can cause blindness, kidney failure, heart disease and other serious conditions.
        There is no complete solutions to diabetes but it can prevented.  Here are some ways to avoid getting diabetes</p>
        <ol>
        <li> Cut Sugar and Refined Carbohydrates From Your Diet-
             Eating sugary foods and refined carbohydrates can put at-risk individuals on the fast track to developing diabetes.</li>
     
        <li>Drink Water as Your Primary Beverage-
        Drinking water instead of other beverages may help control blood sugar and insulin levels, 
        thereby reducing the risk of diabetes.</li>
        
        <li> Weight If You're Overweight or Obese- Although not everyone who develops type 2 diabetes is overweight or obese,
         the majority are.</li>
        
        <li>Eat a High-Fiber Diet-
        Consuming a good fiber source at each meal can help prevent spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels, 
        which may help reduce your risk of developing diabetes. Example of high fiber diet  are vegetables, fruits, nuts etc</li>
        
        <li> Intake of Processed Foods-
        Minimizing processed foods and focusing on whole foods with protective effects on health may help decrease the risk of diabetes.</li>
        </ol>
        <P>Based on research, an average Nigerian cannot possibly avoid eating foods or diets rich in starch and carbohydrates:
         this is why SAVE THE AFRICAN CHILD,
         a non governmental organization wish to create awareness for all age to eat the right foods and adopt other lifestyle behaviors 
         that promote healthy blood sugar, insulin levels that will give you the best chance at avoiding diabetes. 
        Social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc will be used to create awareness.
        Leaflets, pamphlets and advertisements can also help create awareness to people.
        Free training will be used to teach people not only the causes of diabetes but also how to prevent or manage it in different cases,
         for example in case of diabetic patient and how to handle the patient, if the patient had a knife cut. 
         This can only happen if we stand together as one to campaign about diabetes till one day nobody dies of diabetes due to lack of knowledge 
         about the causes of diabetes so that people can have good health.</P>
        
        
        <h2>MEANS OF FUNDING OUR PROJECT/CAMPAIGN AND TECHNOLOGIES NEEDED IN IMPROVING DIABETES IN NIGERIA</h2>
        
        <p>MEANS OF FUNDING OUR PROJECT/CAMPAIGN
        Funding is the means by which the capital required to undertake a project, programme or portfolio is secured and then made available as required.
        Funding can be from internal or external sources or a combination of both.
         Internal is using self funding from the members of SAVE THE AFRICAN FUTURE and external is local and international 
         funding from supporters of our campaign.</p>
        
       <h3> TECHNOLOGIES AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT NEEDED IN IMPROVING DIABETES IN NIGERIA.</h3>
        According to World Health Organization 425 million people have diabetes in th ce world and more than 16 million people in the African Region; by 2045 it will be around 41 million. There were 1,702.900 cases of diabetes in Nigeria in 2015.
        People with diabetes today spend hours each week carefully tracking blood glucose levels, food intake and physical exercise to calculate when and how much insulin should be injected into their bodies. 
        The effective treatment of diabetes begins with patient education by creating awareness.
        Technologies needed in improving diabetes include: 
        <ul>
        <li>Blood Glucose Metres -Is self-testing blood sugar (blood glucose) that important tool in managing treatment
         plan and preventing diabetes complications. </li>
        <li>Timesulin - An insulin pen that can tell you when you last took a dose</li>
        <li>An insulin pump - A small, computerized device that delivers insulin continuously throughout the day.</li>
        <li> Insulin injection - Used to control blood sugar in people who have type 1 diabetes
         (condition in which the body does not make insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) 
         or in people who have type 2 diabetes (condition in which the blood sugar is too high because
          the body does not produce or use insulin normally) that cannot be controlled with oral medications alone. 
          nsulin injection is in a class of medications called hormones. Insulin injection is used to take the place of insulin 
          that is normally produced by the body.</li>
        </ul>
